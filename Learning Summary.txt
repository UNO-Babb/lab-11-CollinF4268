Grocery Store Simulation â€” Python Learning Summary

This mini-project helped me level up on Python skills:

I used SimPy generators (yield env.timeout(...)) to model shopping and checkout steps.

I learned how to track shared data in global lists and counters.

Splitting the code into small functions (shopper, checker, main, etc.) made everything easier to read and tweak.

Adding random.seed(...) showed me how to switch between unpredictable runs and repeatable tests.

Overall, this lab was a fun way to practice structuring clean, modular Python code and working with an external library.
